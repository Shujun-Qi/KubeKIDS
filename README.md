# KubeKIDS

This is the code implementation for CPS 512 project. To simplify the tests we run particants (cloud enclave, KubeKIDS, Trusted party as a Kubernetes pod in the cluster.) This repo contains all code files that is sufficient to build docker images and deploy pods on Kubernetes.

The Kubernetes environment set up is done with our previous project https://github.com/Shujun-Qi/Kube_HQ.git.
